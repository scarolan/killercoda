Welcome to your interactive Grafana & Prometheus lab!

This environment lets you gets hands-on with Prometheus and Grafana. When setup is complete, youâ€™ll see the Grafana logo in your terminal.

The lab starts on the console tab (Tab 1). You can run Linux commands in this terminal window.

Click on the **Editor** tab to access the Theia browser-based IDE. The Editor tab also includes a terminal where you can run commands.

Open the hamburger menu (â˜°) in the upperâ€‘right to access Grafana and Prometheus on their respective ports. Prometheus is running on portâ€¯9090 and Grafana is running on portâ€¯3000.

You can generate some system load by running this command in the terminal. It will drive CPU usage up to 80% for 60 seconds.
```bash
stress-ng --cpu 1 --cpu-load 80 --timeout 60s
```

You can use the `btop` command to monitor system resources in real-time. This is a great way to see how your system is performing while you explore Grafana and Prometheus. Simply leave btop running and open a new terminal tab to run commands.

Happy exploring and happy observing! ðŸŽ‰
