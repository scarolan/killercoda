This is an interactive lab environment where you can experiment with Grafana and the Alloy agent.

When the lab environment is done setting up you will see the Grafana logo in your terminal.

Grafana is running on port 3000 and Alloy can be reached on port 12345. Use the hamburger (triple line) menu in the upper right corner and select *Traffic/Ports* to access them in a new tab.
